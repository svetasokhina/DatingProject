                In the following assignment, you will be presented with several web pages. <br>
                Each page contains a "dating app like" profile and you are requested to rate each profile.
                In order to complete the assignment and get credit for it, you must rate all the profiles you are presented with, as well as answer the mandatory questions following the profiles. <br><br>

                Browsing back through the profiles is not possible; once you submit your rating you won't be able to change it.<br><br>

                At the end of the assignment you will reach the "Completion page" where you will receive a code and be requested to submit it in the Amazon Mechanical Turk assignment page. <br><br>

               There is no time limit; to complete the assignment please make sure you have approximately 15 minutes to spare (the average time it takes to complete the assignment).<br><br>

               Please perform the assignment independently (only by yourself).<br>
               Please do not transfer any information regarding the experiment content (either pictures or texts) to anyone.<br><br>

               Note that at any time you can exit the experiment by pressing the red button. In this case the task will not be completed and therefore you will not receive any credit for it.<br><br>
